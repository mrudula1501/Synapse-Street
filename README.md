# Synapse Street
**AI Multi-Agent System for Stock Market Short Detection**

> **Original Project**: UB Hacking 2024 | **Contributors**: Siddharth Adhikari, Sathwick Kiran M S, Kundan Satkar, Mrudula Deshmukh

## 🎯 Overview

Synapse Street is an AI-powered multi-agent system that detects potential short-selling opportunities in the U.S. stock market by combining machine learning, large language models, and vector databases.

Inspired by *The Big Short*, this project autonomously analyzes market data and delivers interpretable results through interactive dashboards. **Achieved 18% backtest returns** over the evaluation period.

## 🔧 My Core Contributions

### **Vector Search & Semantic Retrieval (Qdrant)**
- Designed and implemented vector database architecture using Qdrant for contextual market signal retrieval
- Engineered embedding pipeline to encode financial metrics (RSI, Moving Average ratios, volatility signals)
- Built semantic search queries to find similar market conditions across historical data
- Optimized query latency for real-time agent decision-making

### **Data Engineering Pipeline (Pandas + Hadoop HDFS)**
- Architected ETL pipeline to process ~5GB U.S. stock market dataset from Kaggle
- Implemented feature engineering workflows with Pandas (OHLCV normalization, technical indicators)
- Integrated Hadoop HDFS distributed storage on 2-node Vultr cluster for scalable data management
- Performed data validation, deduplication, and quality assurance on millions of records

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph)**
- Collaborated on designing StateGraph architecture for 3 autonomous AI agents:
  - **Analyst Agent**: Detects volatility spikes and overbought market conditions
  - **Model Agent**: Evaluates short probabilities from ML pipeline and generates risk scores
  - **Risk Agent**: Assesses portfolio exposure and creates human-readable narratives
- Implemented inter-agent communication patterns and state management

## 📈 Model Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load historical OHLCV data from Kaggle
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate technical indicators (RSI, MA, volatility)
3. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression on normalized features
4. **Vector Encoding**: Convert signals to embeddings for semantic search
5. **Agent Analysis**: 
   - Analyst identifies high-volatility candidates
   - Model scores short probabilities
   - Risk agent validates exposure
6. **Output**: Rankings and narratives for top opportunities
